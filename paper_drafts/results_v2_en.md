# 3. Results and Discussion

## 3.1 Thermal Performance Comparison at 10W Heating Power

The thermal performance of three TPMS structures—Gyroid, IWP, and Primitive—was evaluated under a constant heating power of 10W to establish baseline behavior in the low-power regime. The results reveal significant differences in melting dynamics and thermal uniformity across the three architectures.

**Melting Duration.** At 10W, the IWP structure exhibited the longest complete melting duration of 12.33 minutes, followed by Gyroid at 11.83 minutes, while the Primitive structure melted substantially faster at 9.43 minutes. This represents a 30.8% longer melting time for IWP compared to Primitive, indicating fundamentally different heat transfer characteristics despite identical boundary conditions and PCM volume. The extended melting duration of IWP suggests superior heat distribution capability at low power input, allowing more effective utilization of available thermal energy for phase change.

**Temperature Gradients.** Thermal uniformity was assessed through the temperature difference between measurement points A and B at two critical temperatures: 42°C (early melting stage) and 55°C (advanced melting stage). At 42°C, the Gyroid structure demonstrated superior thermal uniformity with A-B temperature differences of only 4.43°C, compared to 6.12°C for IWP and 7.44°C for Primitive. This represents a 27.6% improvement over IWP and a 40.5% improvement over Primitive.

This advantage became more pronounced at 55°C, where Gyroid maintained a relatively modest gradient of 5.50°C, while IWP reached 7.33°C and Primitive exhibited a substantially larger gradient of 11.25°C. The Gyroid structure's gradient increased by only 24.2% from 42°C to 55°C, compared to 19.8% for IWP and a dramatic 51.2% for Primitive. This differential gradient evolution indicates that while all structures experience increasing thermal heterogeneity as melting progresses, the Primitive architecture suffers from severe thermal bottlenecking largely absent in the Gyroid design.

**Gradient Expansion Analysis.** The relative expansion of temperature gradients from 42°C to 55°C provides insight into thermal stability during the melting process. Gyroid showed a gradient expansion of 24.25%, indicating moderate thermal heterogeneity development. IWP exhibited similar behavior with 19.77% expansion, suggesting comparable thermal stability despite its longer melting duration. In stark contrast, Primitive displayed a dramatic gradient expansion of 51.14%, more than double that of Gyroid, indicating severe thermal non-uniformity as melting progressed.

The Primitive structure's poor thermal uniformity can be attributed to its simpler channel geometry, which provides fewer parallel heat transfer pathways and is more susceptible to localized thermal resistance variations. As the PCM melts and natural convection develops, the Primitive architecture's limited connectivity prevents effective redistribution of thermal energy, leading to hot spot formation.

These results establish that at low heating power, the IWP architecture provides optimal melting duration while Gyroid achieves superior thermal uniformity, with both significantly outperforming the Primitive structure.

## 3.2 Effect of Heating Power on Thermal Performance

Increasing the heating power from 10W to 20W and 30W revealed power-dependent behavior that fundamentally alters the performance hierarchy among TPMS structures.

**Melting Duration Reduction.** All three structures exhibited dramatic reductions in melting duration with increasing power, but the magnitude of reduction varied substantially. For Gyroid, melting time decreased from 11.83 minutes at 10W to 2.22 minutes at 20W and further to 0.62 minutes at 30W, representing a total reduction factor of 19.1×. The reduction from 10W to 20W was 5.3×, while the additional reduction from 20W to 30W was only 3.6×, indicating diminishing sensitivity at higher power levels.

IWP showed a more dramatic response, decreasing from 12.33 minutes to 0.93 minutes (20W) and 0.40 minutes (30W), a total reduction of 30.8×. The 10W-to-20W reduction was 13.3×, and the 20W-to-30W reduction was 2.33×, demonstrating extreme sensitivity to moderate power increases but relative stability at the highest power level. Primitive exhibited the most extreme sensitivity, collapsing from 9.43 minutes to 0.60 minutes (20W) and 0.28 minutes (30W), a reduction factor of 33.7×.

**Temperature Gradient Evolution.** The temperature gradients exhibited complex power-dependent behavior. At 20W, all structures showed increased absolute gradients: Gyroid reached 9.08°C at 42°C and 12.70°C at 55°C; IWP reached 11.12°C and 14.64°C respectively; Primitive showed the highest gradients at 13.96°C and 19.44°C. The gradient expansion ratios at 20W were 39.87% for Gyroid, 31.64% for IWP, and 39.31% for Primitive, indicating that moderate power increases amplify thermal heterogeneity across all architectures.

Notably, Gyroid's gradient expansion increased from 24.25% at 10W to 39.87% at 20W, a 64.4% increase in the expansion ratio itself. This suggests that even the most thermally uniform structure experiences significant degradation in performance when subjected to moderate power increases.

At 30W, the gradients continued to increase but with different relative magnitudes. Gyroid maintained the lowest gradients (12.41°C at 42°C, 15.75°C at 55°C), while IWP showed 14.66°C and 19.76°C, and Primitive exhibited the highest values at 16.08°C and 24.13°C. The gradient expansion ratios at 30W shifted significantly: Gyroid showed 26.91%, IWP increased to 34.79%, and Primitive reached 50.01%. This indicates that high power operation exacerbates thermal non-uniformity, particularly in the Primitive architecture, while Gyroid actually improves its gradient stability relative to 20W conditions.

## 3.3 Performance Ranking Reversal: A Critical Discovery

The most significant finding of this study is the reversal of performance ranking between IWP and Gyroid structures as heating power increases, a phenomenon that has not been previously reported in TPMS-based thermal energy storage systems.

**Low-Power Regime (10W).** At 10W heating power, IWP clearly outperforms Gyroid in terms of melting duration, with 12.33 minutes versus 11.83 minutes—a 4.2% advantage. Both structures significantly outperform Primitive (9.43 minutes), establishing a clear performance hierarchy: IWP > Gyroid >> Primitive. The IWP structure's superior performance at low power can be attributed to its complex, interconnected channel network that maximizes surface area for heat transfer while maintaining excellent fluid connectivity.

**High-Power Regime (20W and 30W).** The performance ranking undergoes a complete reversal at elevated power levels. At 20W, Gyroid achieves a melting duration of 2.22 minutes, which is 138% longer than IWP's 0.93 minutes. This ranking inversion becomes even more pronounced at 30W, where Gyroid maintains 0.62 minutes compared to IWP's 0.40 minutes—a 55% advantage. The performance hierarchy at high power is thus: Gyroid > IWP > Primitive, with Gyroid now clearly dominant.

**Mechanism of Ranking Reversal.** This reversal can be attributed to the different responses of the two architectures to increased heat flux. The IWP structure, while excellent at distributing low-intensity heat throughout the PCM volume, appears to reach a thermal saturation point where additional power cannot be effectively utilized. Once the thermal resistance of the solid-liquid interface is overcome, the IWP structure's complex geometry may actually impede rapid heat transfer due to flow restrictions or thermal bottlenecks in certain regions, leading to rapid but inefficient melting.

In contrast, the Gyroid structure's continuous, interconnected channels with smooth curvature provide more robust heat transfer pathways that scale more effectively with increasing power input. The Gyroid's geometry allows for both efficient conduction through the solid ligaments and effective convection in the molten PCM, creating multiple synergistic heat transfer mechanisms that become more effective at higher power levels. This allows Gyroid to maintain longer melting durations even under high heat flux conditions.

This discovery has profound implications for the design of TPMS-based thermal energy storage systems, as it demonstrates that the optimal structure selection is not absolute but depends critically on the intended operating power range.

## 3.4 Power Sensitivity Analysis

The sensitivity of each TPMS structure to heating power variations was quantified by analyzing the reduction factor in melting duration across the power range from 10W to 30W.

**Gyroid: Low Sensitivity.** The Gyroid structure exhibited the lowest power sensitivity, with melting duration decreasing by a factor of only 19.1× over the three-fold power increase. This relatively modest response indicates that Gyroid's thermal performance is robust to power variations, making it suitable for applications with fluctuating or unpredictable heat input. The gradual reduction suggests that Gyroid maintains effective heat distribution even at high power levels, avoiding thermal bottlenecks or localized overheating.

The low sensitivity of Gyroid can be quantified by examining the power-normalized melting duration. At 10W, the melting duration per watt is 1.175 min/W; at 20W, it is 0.105 min/W; and at 30W, it is 0.021 min/W. While these values decrease with power, the rate of decrease is more gradual than for the other structures, indicating that Gyroid's performance degradation is more predictable and manageable.

**IWP and Primitive: High Sensitivity.** Both IWP and Primitive structures demonstrated high power sensitivity, with reduction factors of 30.8× and 33.7× respectively—roughly 1.6–1.8× higher than Gyroid's 19.1× sensitivity. This indicates that these architectures are highly optimized for specific power ranges but perform poorly when operated outside their design conditions. The dramatic reduction in melting duration suggests that these structures experience thermal saturation, where additional power input leads to rapid phase change rather than improved heat distribution.

For IWP, the power-normalized melting duration decreases from 1.233 min/W at 10W to 0.047 min/W at 20W and 0.013 min/W at 30W, representing a 95-fold decrease over the power range. Primitive shows similar behavior, with power-normalized melting duration decreasing from 0.828 min/W to 0.028 min/W to 0.009 min/W, an 89-fold decrease.

**Implications for System Design.** The power sensitivity analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off in TPMS design. Low-sensitivity structures like Gyroid offer operational flexibility and robustness but may not achieve peak performance at any specific power level. High-sensitivity structures like IWP and Primitive can be optimized for maximum performance at a target power level but suffer significant performance degradation when operated at different conditions.

This trade-off must be carefully considered in the context of the intended application. For applications with stable, well-defined power input, high-sensitivity structures can be optimized for peak performance at the design point. For applications with variable power input, such as solar thermal systems with diurnal and weather-driven fluctuations, the low-sensitivity Gyroid structure offers more consistent performance across the operating range.

## 3.5 Discussion and Engineering Implications

The experimental results presented in this study reveal several critical insights for the design and optimization of TPMS-based thermal energy storage systems.

**Thermal Uniformity and Structure Selection.** Across all power levels, the Gyroid structure consistently demonstrated the lowest temperature gradients, indicating superior thermal uniformity. At 10W, Gyroid's A-B temperature difference at 55°C was 5.50°C, compared to 7.33°C for IWP and 11.25°C for Primitive. This advantage persisted at 20W (12.70°C vs. 14.64°C vs. 19.44°C) and 30W (15.75°C vs. 19.76°C vs. 24.13°C). The superior thermal uniformity of Gyroid can be attributed to its triply periodic, interconnected channel network with smooth, continuous curvature, which provides multiple parallel heat transfer pathways and minimizes thermal resistance variations throughout the structure.

For applications requiring precise temperature control or uniform heat distribution—such as electronic cooling, thermal management of battery systems, or temperature-sensitive industrial processes—Gyroid emerges as the clear choice regardless of operating power.

**Power-Dependent Optimization.** The performance ranking reversal between IWP and Gyroid demonstrates that structure selection must be power-dependent. For low-power applications (≤10W), IWP provides optimal melting duration while maintaining acceptable thermal uniformity. For high-power applications (≥20W), Gyroid becomes the superior choice, offering both longer melting duration and better thermal uniformity.

This power-dependent optimization has practical implications for system designers. In applications with fixed, known power input, the structure can be selected to match the operating conditions. In applications with variable power input, such as solar thermal systems or waste heat recovery with fluctuating sources, the low-sensitivity Gyroid structure offers more consistent performance across the operating range.

**Primitive Structure: Limited Applicability.** The Primitive structure consistently underperformed across all metrics and power levels. Its high gradient expansion ratios (51.14% at 10W, 39.31% at 20W, 50.01% at 30W) indicate fundamental limitations in heat distribution capability. While Primitive may offer advantages in terms of manufacturing simplicity or mechanical properties, its thermal performance characteristics make it unsuitable for applications requiring uniform heat distribution or extended melting duration.

**Scaling Considerations.** The dramatic reduction in melting duration with increasing power—ranging from 19.1× to 30.8× over a three-fold power increase—highlights the nonlinear relationship between power input and thermal performance. This nonlinearity must be accounted for in system design and control strategies. Simply increasing heating power does not proportionally extend melting duration; instead, the TPMS structure's ability to distribute heat effectively becomes the limiting factor.

**Future Research Directions.** The performance ranking reversal discovered in this study opens several avenues for future research. First, hybrid structures that combine the low-power advantages of IWP with the high-power advantages of Gyroid could be explored through topology optimization or functionally graded designs. Second, the mechanisms underlying the power sensitivity differences should be investigated through detailed numerical simulations to elucidate the heat transfer pathways and thermal resistance networks within each structure. Third, the generalizability of these findings to other TPMS families and other PCM materials should be validated to establish broader design principles.

**Concluding Remarks.** This study demonstrates that the thermal performance of TPMS structures is not an intrinsic property but emerges from the complex interaction between structure topology, heating power, and phase change dynamics. The performance ranking reversal between IWP and Gyroid, the superior thermal uniformity of Gyroid across all conditions, and the high power sensitivity of IWP and Primitive structures provide critical insights for the rational design of TPMS-based thermal energy storage systems. These findings establish a foundation for power-dependent structure selection and highlight the need for application-specific optimization in the deployment of TPMS technologies for thermal management.
