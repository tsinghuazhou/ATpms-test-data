However, experimental comparisons of different TPMS topologies under controlled thermal loading remain scarce, and no prior study has simultaneously compared three TPMS architectures in PCM-integrated lattice structures. This study presents a systematic experimental investigation of the thermal performance of three TPMS architectures — Gyroid, IWP (I-Wrapped Package), and Primitive (Schwarz-P) — integrated with paraffin-based PCM. Lattice structures were fabricated from AlSi10Mg alloy via laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing, with specimen dimensions of 50 × 50 × 20 mm³. A commercial paraffin wax with a phase change temperature of 42 °C was vacuum-infused into the lattice pores. Transient heating experiments were conducted at three constant power levels (10 W, 20 W, and 30 W) under uniform heat flux boundary conditions, with nine thermocouples distributed across three vertical layers to capture the spatiotemporal evolution of temperature fields. Results reveal a critical power-dependent performance ranking reversal: at 10 W heating, IWP achieves the longest melting duration (12.33 min) compared to Gyroid (11.83 min) and Primitive (9.43 min); however, at 20 W and 30 W, the ranking reverses completely, with Gyroid achieving 2.22 min and 0.62 min respectively, compared to IWP's 0.93 min and 0.40 min. Gyroid consistently demonstrates superior thermal uniformity across all power levels (A–B gradient: 4.43–15.75 °C vs. 6.12–19.76 °C for IWP and 7.44–24.13 °C for Primitive) and exhibits the lowest power sensitivity (melting duration reduction factor of 19.1× from 10 W to 30 W, compared to 30.8× for IWP and 33.7× for Primitive). These findings establish power-dependent topology selection criteria: Gyroid is optimal for wide power range and high-power applications, while IWP excels at low-power precision thermal management."),

            textPara("The relentless miniaturization and performance escalation of modern electronic devices have imposed increasingly stringent thermal management demands. As power densities in electronics continue to rise — exceeding 100 W/cm² in advanced microprocessors and high-power LEDs — conventional passive cooling strategies such as fin arrays and heat spreaders are approaching their fundamental limits [1]. Efficient thermal management is critical for ensuring device reliability and maintaining performance stability under transient thermal loads, driving sustained research interest in advanced thermal regulation technologies that accommodate high heat fluxes within compact form factors."),
            textPara("Phase change materials (PCMs) have emerged as a compelling solution for passive thermal energy storage and transient thermal management. By absorbing and releasing large quantities of latent heat during solid–liquid phase transitions at nearly constant temperatures, PCMs can effectively buffer thermal spikes and maintain component temperatures within safe operating windows [3]. Paraffin waxes are widely employed owing to their high latent heat capacity, chemical stability, and suitable phase change temperatures for electronics cooling. However, their inherently low thermal conductivity (typically 0.2–0.4 W/m·K) severely limits heat absorption and release rates, resulting in sluggish thermal response and incomplete latent heat utilization. Overcoming this limitation requires high-conductivity structural scaffolds that enhance effective thermal transport throughout the PCM volume."),
            textPara("Metallic lattice structures have been extensively investigated as conductive matrices for PCM composites. Among these, triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) architectures have attracted considerable attention due to their high surface-area-to-volume ratios, interconnected pore networks, and mechanically efficient topologies [1,5]. TPMS structures are defined by zero-mean-curvature surfaces that partition three-dimensional space into two continuous, interpenetrating sub-volumes. Several distinct TPMS topologies exist, each offering unique channel geometry and flow characteristics that profoundly influence heat transfer performance. The Gyroid surface features a single continuous channel with chiral symmetry, generating helical flow paths that promote fluid mixing and secondary convection [6]. The Primitive (Schwarz-P) surface comprises two independent, mutually interpenetrating channel networks connected through periodic openings, yielding bidirectional transport pathways with distinct tortuosity. The IWP (I-Wrapped Package) surface similarly partitions space into two independent interpenetrating channel networks, yet differs fundamentally from the Primitive in its wrapping topology: the IWP channels exhibit a more complex cage-like enclosure with higher genus and greater surface area per unit volume, producing enhanced flow confinement and altered thermal transport pathways [5,6]. These three topologies thus span a rich design space of channel connectivity, tortuosity, and confinement, making their systematic comparison essential for advancing TPMS-based thermal management (see Fig. 1 for a visualization of the three TPMS architectures)."),
            textPara("Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of TPMS-based structures for enhanced PCM thermal management. Qureshi et al. [1] investigated TPMS-based metal foams as heat sinks for PCM and reported significant improvements in temperature uniformity and charging time reduction compared to conventional foam geometries. In a subsequent study, Qureshi et al. [2] explored 3D-printed TPMS lattice structures integrated with PCM, demonstrating the feasibility of fabricating complex periodic architectures with tailored thermal performance. Gado [3] conducted numerical investigations of TPMS heat sinks filled with PCM and showed that the Gyroid topology outperformed the Primitive and Diamond surfaces in melting rate and thermal storage efficiency. Tang et al. [6] examined convective heat transfer in Gyroid structures and revealed the interplay between secondary flows induced by chiral channel geometry and thermal transport enhancement. Kaur and Singh [5] established design correlations for the Nusselt number and friction factor across multiple TPMS topologies in heat exchanger applications."),
            textPara("The advent of additive manufacturing (AM), particularly laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF), has enabled the fabrication of TPMS lattice structures with unprecedented geometric accuracy and surface quality [2]. Unlike conventional methods constrained by mold design and demolding complexity, AM allows direct realization of mathematically defined TPMS geometries with precise control over strut dimensions, porosity, and unit cell size. Guo et al. [21] demonstrated a 3D-printed lattice heat sink integrated with PCM for electronics cooling, showing that the enhanced thermal conductivity network significantly reduced peak temperatures during transient operation. Zhou and Qiao [23] investigated heat transfer in copper foam saturated with PCM and highlighted the importance of pore-scale morphology in determining effective thermal performance."),
            textPara("Despite these advances, a significant gap remains in the experimental understanding of TPMS-PCM coupled thermal systems. The majority of existing studies have relied on numerical simulations or analytical models to predict the thermal behavior of TPMS-PCM configurations [1,3]. Experimental investigations that directly compare different TPMS topologies under controlled and reproducible thermal loading conditions are notably scarce. In particular, no prior experimental study has simultaneously compared three TPMS topologies — Gyroid, Primitive, and IWP — in PCM-integrated lattice structures. The influence of heating power on the transient thermal response, phase change dynamics, and spatial temperature distribution across these three topologies has not been systematically characterized through experiments. Understanding these relationships is essential for validating computational models, establishing power-dependent performance rankings, and providing design guidelines for practical engineering applications."),
            textPara("This study presents the first systematic experimental investigation of the thermal performance of three TPMS lattice topologies — Gyroid, Primitive, and IWP — integrated with paraffin-based PCM. The TPMS lattice structures were fabricated from AlSi10Mg alloy using L-PBF additive manufacturing, with sample dimensions of 50 × 50 × 20 mm³. A paraffin-based PCM with a phase change temperature of 42 °C was infiltrated into the lattice pores. Transient heating experiments were conducted at three power levels (10 W, 20 W, and 30 W) under constant heat flux boundary conditions. Multiple thermocouples were strategically positioned at three vertical layers to capture the spatial and temporal evolution of temperature fields during the heating and phase change processes. The primary objectives of this study are: (1) to compare the thermal performance of Gyroid, Primitive, and IWP TPMS lattices in terms of temperature uniformity, thermal gradients, and PCM melting dynamics; (2) to characterize the effect of heating power on the transient thermal response and phase change behavior across all three topologies; (3) to establish a power-dependent performance ranking of the three TPMS structures, identifying optimal topology selection criteria for different operating conditions; and (4) to provide experimental benchmark data that can inform the design optimization of TPMS-based PCM thermal management systems for electronics cooling applications."),
